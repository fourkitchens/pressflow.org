Modernizr for Drupal
====================

This module implements Modernizr, the client-side feature detection
library. Modernizr allows you to avoid user-agent sniffing on the
server, and rely on the honesty of the browsers that visit your
website by detecting each individual feature that they support.

Modernizr will inject yes/no classes into your <html> tag for each
test, so that you can write conditional rules based on the results:

    .multiplebgs div p {
      /* properties for browsers that
         support multiple backgrounds */
    }
    .no-multiplebgs div p {
      /* optional fallback properties
         for browsers that don't */
    }

Modernizr v2 optionally includes a script loader which can load
additional resources based on the outcome of specific Modernizr
tests you're interested in:

    Modernizr.load({
      test : Modernizr.geolocation,
      yep  : 'normal.js',
      nope : ['polyfill.js', 'wrapper.js']
    });

The 3.x branch of the Drupal module aims to integrate Modernizr.load()
so it is available to themes/modules that support HTML5/CSS3 features.

Drupal components
=================

The code incudes an optional submodule (modernizr_forceredirect) that
was for the 1.x version of modernizr.js and is no longer needed for v2.
We strongly recommend using the latest version of Modernizr, and can
only support the latest version of the JS library. The _forceredirect
module will likely be removed for 3.x release.
